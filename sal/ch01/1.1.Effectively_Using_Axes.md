# 1.1 Effective Using Axes

## The Context node

The context node in XSLT is set by:

- a template match
- xsl:for-each
- xsl:apply-templates

To set the context using our XPath tool, we can specify it with the command
line.

## Child and descendant axes

```
cat sal/ch01/1.1.0.xml
# set the context to "//parent/" as described in the book

try -d sal/ch01 xpath -x 1.1.0.xml -c "//parent/" -p "X"

try xpath -p X
try xpath -p "X[last()]"

# select the first element provided it is an X. Otherwise empty
try xpath -p "*[1][self::X]"

# select the last element provided it is an X
try xpath -p "//parent/*[last()][self::X]"

# select all descendants of X
try xpath -p "//parent/*[last()][self::X]"

# select the context node and all descendant elements:
try xpath -p "//parent/descentant-or-self::*"
```

## Sibling axes

```
cat sal/ch01/1.1.1.xml

# select a new file, select the A tag with an attribute set to 7
try xpath -x 1.1.1.xml -c "/Test/A[@id=7]/" -p ""

# Select the preceding A siblings before A[@id=7]
try xpath -p "preceding-sibling::A"

# Select the following sibling if it's an A
try xpath -p "following-sibling::A"

# Select the preceding siblings
try xpath -p "preceding-sibling::*"

# Select the preceding sibling element A in reverse document order
try xpath -p "preceding-sibling::A[1]"

# Select the preceding element in reverse document order, provided it is an A.
try xpath -p "preceding-sibling::*[1][self::A]"

# Select preceding sibling elements that are not A elements:
try xpath -p "preceding-sibling::*[not(self::A)]"

```

## Parent and ancestor axes

```
cat sal/ch01/1.1.2.xml
try -d sal/ch01 xpath -x "1.1.2.xml" -c "//parent/Y[id=3]/" -p "X"
"
```

## Preceding and following axis
```
```
