# 1.7 Using Set Operators

## Problem

You want to process sequences as if they are mathematical sets.

## Solution

The ``|`` operator on XPath 1.0 remain in 2.0, but ``union`` is added as an
alias.  In addition ``intersect`` and ``except`` for intersection and set-difference were added.

```
$set1 union $set2

$set1 intersect $set2

$set1 except $set2

# all attributes except @a
@* except @a

# all attributes except @a and @b
@* except @a, @b

```
