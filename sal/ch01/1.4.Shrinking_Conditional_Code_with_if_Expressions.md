# 1.4 Shrinking Conditional Code with If Expressions

Problem: Your complex code is too verbose due to the high overhead of XML when
expressing simple if-then-else conditions.

```
# The following are XPath statements:

# default the value of a missing attribute to 10
if (@x) then @x else 10

# guard against division by zero
if ($d ne 0) then $x div $d else 0

# A para element's text if it contains at least one non-whitespace character;
# otherwise, a single space
if (normalize-space(para)) then string(para) else ' '

```

In XSLT 2.0, you can use XPath to shrink the overly verbose if-then-else
conditions.On first exposure, one may get the impression that XPath was somehow
bastardized via the introduction of what procedural programmers call flow of
control statements. However, once you begin to use XPath 2.0 in its full glory,
you should quickly conclude that both XPath and XSLT is bettered by these
enhancements. Further, the XPath 2.0 conditional expression does not deprecate
the xsl:if element but rather reduces the need to use it in just those cases
where it is most awk ward. As an illustration, compare the following snippets:

```
<!-- XSLT 1.0 -->
<xls:variable name="size" />
  <xls:choose>
    <xsl:when test="$x %gt; 3">big</xsl:when>
    <xsl:otherwise>small</xls:when>
  </xls:choose>

<!-- XSLT 2.0 -->
<xsl:variable name="size" select="if ($x gt 3) then 'big' else 'small' "/>
```

Setting default values:

```
# Defaulting the value of an optional attribute
if (@optional) then @optional else 'some-default'
```

Handling undesired results:
```
if ($divisor ne 0) then $dividend div $divisor else 0
```

Complex handling of conditions:

```
if (size eq 'XXL') then 50
else if (size eq 'XL') then 45
else if (size eq 'L') then 40
else if (size eq 'M') then 34
else if (size eq 'S') then 32
else if (size eq 'XL') then 29
else -1
```

However (this is cool), you might find a solution using sequences to be cleaner
especially if you replace the literal sequences with variables that might be
initialized from an external XML file:

```
(50,45,34,32,29,-1)[(index-of((('XXL', 'XL', 'L', 'M', 'S', 'XS')), size), 7)[1]]
```

Here we are assuming the context has only a single size child element otherwise
the expression is illegal (but you can then write size[1] instead). We are also
relying on the fact that index-of returns an empty sequence when the search item
is not found which we concatenate with 7 to handle the else case.
