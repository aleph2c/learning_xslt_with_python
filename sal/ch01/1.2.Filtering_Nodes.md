# Filtering Nodes

You need to select nodes base on the data they contain or in addition to their
name or position

```
cat sal/ch01/1.2.0.xml
try -d sal/ch01 xpath -x "1.2.0.xml" -c "/Test/parent/" -p "*"

# select X child elements that have an attribute named a
try xpath -p "X[@a]"

# select X children that have at least one attribute
try xpath -p "X[@*]"

# select X children who have at least 3 attributes
try xpath -p "X[count(@*) > 2]"

# select X children whose attributes sum to a value less than 7
try xpath -p "X[sum(foreach $a in @* return number($a)]"

# select X children that have no attributes
try xpath -p "X[not(@*)]"

# Select X children that have a child named Z with a value of 10
try xpath -p "X[Z eq '10']"

# Select X children if they have at least one child text node
try xpath -p "X[text()]"

# Select X children if they ahve a text node with at least one non-whitespace
# character
try xpath -p "X[text()[normalize-space(.)]]"

# Select X children if they have any child node
try xpath -p "X[node()]"

# Select X children if they have @a whose numerical value is less than 10.
try xpath -p "X[number(@a) < 10]"

# Select X if it has at least one preceding sibling name Z with an attribute y
# that is not equal to 10
try xpath -p "X[preciding-sibling::Z/@y ne '10']

# X elements with exactly five child elements
try xpath -p "x[count(*) eq 5]"


```
