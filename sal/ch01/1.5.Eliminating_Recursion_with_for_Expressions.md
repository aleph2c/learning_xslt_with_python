# 1.5 Eliminating Recursion with for Expressions

## Problem

You want to derive an output sequence from an input sequence where each
item in the output is an arbitrarily complex function of the input and the sizes
of each sequence are not necessarily the same.

## Solution

Use XPath 2.0's for expression.  Here we show four cases demonstrating how the
for expression can map sequences of differing input and output sizes.

Aggregation:

```
# Sum of squares
sum(for $x in $numbers return $x * $x)

# Average of squares
avg(for $x in $numbers return $x * $x)

```

Mapping (like a list comprehension):

```
# Map a sequence of words in all paragraphs to a sequence of word lengths
# like [string-length($x) for $x in //para/tokonize(., ' ')]
for $x in //para/tokenize(., ' ') return string-length($x)

# Map a squence of workd in a paragraph to a sequence of word lengths for words
# greater than three letters
# like [
#   string-length($x) for $x in //para/tokenize(., ' ') if (string-length($x) gt 3
# ]
for $x in //para/tokenize(., ' ') return if (string-length($x) gt 3) then string-length($x) else ()

# Same as above with different condition logic.  The if statement is linked to
# the input sequence
# like [
#  string-length($x) for $x in //para/tokenize(., ' ') if [string-length(.) gt 3]
# ]
for $x in //para/tokenize(., ' ')[string-length(.) gt 3] return string-length($x)
```

Generating:

```
# Generate a sequence of squares for the first 100 integers
for $i in 1 to 100 return $i * $i

# Generate a sequence of squares for the first 100 integers, but in reverse order
for $i in 0 to 10 return (10 - $i) * (10 - $i)

```

Expanding:

```
# Map a sequence of paragraphs to a duped sequence of paragraphs
for $x in //para return ($x, $x)

# Duplicate words
for $x in //para/tokenize(., ' ') return ($x, $x)

# Map words to word following word length
for $x in //para/tokenize(., ' ') return ($x, string-length($x))

```

Joining:

```
# for each customer, output an id and the total of all the customer orders

for $cust in doc('customer.xml')/*/customer
  return
    ($cust/id/text(),
      sum(for $ord in doc('order.xml')/*/order[custID eq $cust/id]
        return ($ord/total)) )

```

## Disussion

As I indicated in Recipe 1.4, the addition of control flow constructs into an
expression language like XPath might at first be perceived as odd or even misguided.

You will quickly overcome your doubts, however, when you experience the liberating
power of these XPath 2.0 constructs. This is especially true for the XPath 2.0
for expression.

The power of for becomes most apparent when one considers how it can be applied
to reduce many complicated recursive XSLT 1.0 solutions to just a single XPath
2.0 expression. Consider the problem of computing sums in XSLT 1.0. If all you
need is a simple sum, there is no problem because the built-in XPath 1.0 sum
function will do fine. However, if you need to compute the sum of squares, you
are forced to write a larger, more awkward, and less transparent recursive
template. In fact, a good portion of the first edition of this book was recipes
for canned solutions to these recursive gymnastics. With XPath 2.0, a sum of
squares becomes nothing more than sum(for $x in $numbers return $x * $x) where
$numbers contains the sequence of numbers we wish to sum over.

However, the for expression is hiding even more power. You are not limited to
just one iteration variable. Several variables can be combined to create nested
loops that create sequences from interrelated nodes in a complex document.

```
# I don't understand this (the document is in Sal's head)
# Return a sequence consisting of para ids and the ids those para elements
# reference
for $s in /*/section,
  $p in $s/para,
  $r in $p/ref
    return ($p/@id, $r)
```

At this point in his book we are back to the Jenni problem.  He has a clear
picture in his head, but I don't have it.  Also, I am not sure how to use these
XPath expressions within the XSLT documents, or how to test them.  I don't know
the small practical steps to troubleshoot a program.  I'm hoping I will get this
later.
