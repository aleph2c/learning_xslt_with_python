# 1.6 Taming Complex Logic Using Quantifiers

## Problem

You need to test a sequence for the existence of a condition in some or all of
its items.

## Solution

Use the ``some`` and ``every`` expression.

```
# True if at least one section is referenced:
some $id in //para/@id satisies $id = //ref/@idref

# True if all section elements are referenced by some ref element:
every $id in //section/@id satisfies $id = //ref/@idref

# There exists a section that references every section except itself:
some $s in //section satisifies
  every $id in //section[@id ne $s/@id]/@id satisfies $id = $s/ref/@idref

# sequence2 is a sub-sequence of $sequence1
count($sequence2) <= count($sequence1) and
  every $pos in 1 to count($sequence1),
    $item1 in $sequence1[$pos],
    $item2 in $sequence2[$pos] satisfies $item1 = $item2

```
